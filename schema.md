The schema is arranged as follows.

  - `document`: An object that lists basic information about the document, including:
    - `title`: The document title, if detected.
    - `html`: The full text of the input document in HTML format.
    - `hash`: The MD5 hash of the input document.
  - `model_id`: The analysis model to be used by the service. For the `/v1/element_classification` and `/v1/comparison` methods, the default is `contracts`. For the `/v1/tables` method, the default is `tables`. These defaults apply to the stand-alone methods and to the methods' use in batch-processing requests.
  - `model_version`: The version of the analysis model specified by the value of the `model_id` parameter.
  - `elements`: An array of the document elements detected by the service.
    - `location`: The location of the element as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.
    - `text`: The text of the element.
    - `types`: An array that describes what the element is and whom it affects.
      - `label`: An object that defines the type by using a pair of the following elements:
        - `nature`: The type of action the sentence requires. Current values are `Definition`, `Disclaimer`, `Exclusion`, `Obligation`, and `Right`.
        - `party`: A string that identifies the party to whom the sentence applies.
      - `provenance_ids`: An array of one or more hashed values that you can send to IBM to provide feedback or receive support.
    - `categories`: An array that lists the functional categories into which the element falls; in other words, the subject matter of the element.

      - `text`: A string that lists the section title, if detected.
      - `location`: The location of the title in the input document as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.

    - `location`: The location of the date as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.

**\*Notes on tables:**
  - Row and column index values per cell are zero-based and so begin with `0`.
  - Multiple values in arrays of `row_header_ids` and `row_header_texts` elements indicate a possible hierarchy of row headers.
  - Multiple values in arrays of `column_header_ids` and `column_header_texts` elements indicate a possible hierarchy of column headers.
