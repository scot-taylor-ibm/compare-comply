# Understanding element classification
{: #contract_parsing}

When you upload a contract to Compare and Comply by specifying the `model_id` value `contracts` on the `/v1/element_classification` method, the service returns the contract with an analysis of each identified element.

The following sections describe how the returned JSON provides the analysis.

## Types
{: #contract_types}

The `types` array includes a number of objects, each of which contains `nature` and `party` keys whose values identify a couplet for the element.

The following tables list the possible values of the `nature` and `party` keys.

| `nature`         |Description                                                |
|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`Definition`      |This element adds clarity for a term, relationship, or similar. No action is required to fulfill the element, nor is any party that is affected.|
|`Disclaimer`      |The `party` in the element is not obligated to fulfterms that are specified by the element but is not prohibited from doing so.|
|`Exclusion`       |The `party` in the element does not fulfill the terms that are specified by the element.|
|`Obligation`      |The `party` in the element is required to fulfill the terms that are specified by the element.|
|`Right`           |The `party` in the element is guaranteed to receive the terms that are specified by the element.|

Each `nature` key is paired with a `party` key, which contains either the name or the role of the party or parties that apply to the nature (examples include, but are not limited to, `Buyer`, `IBM`, or `All Parties`). For the `Definition` nature, the party is always `None`.

## Parties
{: #contract_parties}

The `parties` array specifies the participants that are listed in the contract. Each `party` object is associated with other objects that provide details about the party, including:

  - `role`: The party's role. Values are listed in the table that follows this list.
  - `importance`: The importance of the party. Possible values are `Primary` for a primary party and `Unknown` for a non-primary party.
  - `addresses`: An array that identifies addresses.
    - `text`: An address.
    - `location`: The location of the address as defined by its `begin` and `end` indexes.
  - `contacts`: An array that defines the names and roles of contacts that are identified in the input document.
    - `name`: The name of a contact.
    - `role`: The role of the contact.

The values of `role` that can be returned for contracts include, but are not limited to:

| `role`           |Description                                                |
|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|`Buyer`           |The party responsible for paying for the goods or services that are listed in the contract.|
|`End User`        |The party who interacts with the provided goods or services, explicitly distinguished from the `Buyer`.|
|`None`            |No party was identified for the element.|
|`Supplier`        |The party responsible for providing the goods or services that are listed in the contract.|
